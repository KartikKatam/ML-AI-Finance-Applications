# ML-AI-Finance-Applications

This repository tracks my complete learning and project journey as I transition from a quantum computing background into machine learning-based financial technology.

## What is this REPO
- Demonstrates my progression from fundamentals to advanced applications in Fintech + ML.
- Documents my mastery of foundational skills in Finance, Machine Learning, and Artifial Intelligence. 
- Contains mini-projects, learning notes, and three major capstone projects:
      1. Develop an Adaptive Algorithmic Trading Agent using Reinforcement Learning.
      2. Design a High-Performance Trading System Backtester with C++ Integration to test the Trading Agent
      3. Create a Quantitative Macroeconomic Forecasting model using Bayesian Machine Learning & Physics-Inspired Models



## Structure
- `core_competencies/`: Deep dives on each skill area, with final uploaded notes and a mini-project for each.
- `capstone_projects/`: Three end-to-end advanced projects (macro forecasting, trading agent, agent backtester).
- `resources/`: Articles, books, and research papers I’ve used.
- `progress_log.md`: Timeline and milestones.
- `roadmap.md`: My learning and project plan.
- `templates/`: Note-taking and project templates for easy documentation.

## My Process
For each competency:
1. Learn & document concepts and resources.
2. Implement a focused project.
3. Write up key insights and next steps.
